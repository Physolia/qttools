    \brief This page has an image that has a title attribute.
    \image leonardo-da-vinci.png This is the alternate text for the image
    \caption If you hover over the image, a tooltip should pop up in your
             browser with the text
             "This is the alternate text for the image".

    The image should render as expected, and the alternate text should be
    there, too. This text is contained in its own paragraph following the
    image.
